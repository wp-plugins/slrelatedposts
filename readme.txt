This plug-in installs a sidebar widget and an optional content filter to list
related posts.

== Description ==

SLRelatedPosts is a little plug-in for WordPress. It contains an easy to use
widget to show related posts on the sidebar. Additionally, a content filter can
be installed to list related posts at the end of each post.

The widget implementation is based on the widget API of WordPress 2.8. This API
automatically enables multiple instances of each widget. Configuration values
can be used and managed easily for each widget instance.
